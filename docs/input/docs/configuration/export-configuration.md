Title: Example of Export Configuration
---

Once you have created a number of releases, you might want to export all of the
release notes into a single file. This is especially useful if you want to
embed all the release notes within your application. To cater for this,
GitReleaseManager includes the export command. The format of the resulting file
can be configured via a number of parameters.

Out of the box, GitReleaseManager exports all the release notes for a given
project, exactly as these release notes appear within GitHub. However, there
are certain things that you might want to add, or remove, for the exported file.

Take for example the GitReleaseManager configuration file which is used by the
[Chocolatey GUI](https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI) project:

```yaml
export:
    include-created-date-in-title: true
    created-date-string-format: MMMM dd, yyyy
    perform-regex-removal: true
    regex-text: '### Where to get it(\r\n)*You can .*\)'
    multiline-regex: true
```

This results in a file which looks like this:

![Example Exported Release Notes](../images/example-export.png)

:::{.alert .alert-info}
The important things to note in the above image are that a created date has been
added for each release, via the include-created-date-in-title parameter (and it
is possible to configure the DateTime format string that is used). And also,
the "Where to get it" section has not been included. Since we are including the
release notes within the Chocolatey GUI application, the user already has it
installed, so they don't need to know where to get it.

Assumes that you can create the necessary regular expression, any text can be
removed from the exported set of release notes.

This approach can be used for any project, this example simply shows what is
done in the Chocolatey GUI project.
