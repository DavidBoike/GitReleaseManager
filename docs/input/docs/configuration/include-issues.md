Title: Issues to include
---

In order to include an issue within the release notes that are generated by
GitReleaseManager, each issue within a milestone has to be labelled with one of
a set of pre-defined labels.

Out of the box, GitReleaseManager is configured to include issues that are
tagged with one of the following labels:

```yaml
issue-labels-include:
    - Bug
    - Feature
    - Improvement
```

:::{.alert .alert-info}
You can add as many issue labels into this section as required. Any issue,
included within a milestone that contains a label specified within this list
will be included within the generated release notes.
:::

:::{.alert .alert-warning}
All issues assigned to a milestone have to have a label which matches to one
listed in the include to exclude sections of the GitReleaseManager configuration
file or the default configuration.
