Title: Example of Create Configuration
---

When creating a release, it is possible to control the look and feel of the
release notes, using settings within the GitReleaseManager configuration file.

Out of the box, GitReleaseManager creates a simple list of Issues included
within a milestone, split into the labels that have been configured. However,
it is possible to include additional information in the form of a footer, which
provides additional information, for example, where an installation of the
release can be located.

Take for example the GitReleaseManager configuration file which is used by the
[Chocolatey GUI](https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI) project:

:::{.alert .alert-warning}
Configuring the footer is no longer recommended. Going forward the recommendation
is to configure the footer using separate template files.
Please see [Template Configuration](template-configuration#editing-the-templates)
for more information.
:::

```yaml
create:
    include-footer: true
    footer-heading: Where to get it
    footer-content: You can download this release from [chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolateyGUI/{milestone})
    footer-includes-milestone: true
    milestone-replace-text: "{milestone}"
```

This would result in the following
[release notes](https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI/releases/tag/0.13.1)
being generated:

![Example Release Notes](../images/example-release-notes.png){.img-responsive}

:::{.alert .alert-info}
The generated URL for the link to Chocolatey.org includes the milestone number.
The complete URL is https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolateyGUI/0.13.1. This
was achieved by using a regular expression replacement of the
[footer-content](default-configuration), using the
[milestone-replace-text](default-configuration) property as the text to replace
with the actual milestone.

This approach can be used for any project, this example simply shows what is
done in the Chocolatey GUI project.
