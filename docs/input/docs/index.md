# What is GitReleaseManager?

GitReleaseManager is a tool that will help create a set of release notes for
your application/product. It does this using the collection of issues which
are stored on the GitHub Issue Tracker for your application/product.

By inspecting the issues that have been assigned to a particular milestone,
GitReleaseManager creates a set of release notes, in markdown format, which are
then used to create a Release on GitHub.

In addition to creating a Release, GitReleaseManager can be used to publish a
release, close a milestone, and also to export the complete set of release notes
for your application/product.
