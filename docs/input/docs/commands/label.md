Title: Label
---

When first setting up a repository, it is nice to be able to configure a set of
default labels, so that you can have some consistency across your various
projects.  While GitHub, and other Source Control systems provide a set of
default labels, they are not always exactly what you want.  This command will
remove all the current labels configured within a repository, and create a new
set of them.

:::{.alert .alert-info}
**NOTE:**

The available list of labels that are created is currently hard-coded into
GitReleaseManager, it is not possible to configure them.  This will come in a
later version.
