After creating a draft release, it might be necessary to also discard it. This
could be for a number of reasons, which don't need to be detailed here, but
if/when required, this command will discard a draft release.

:::{.alert .alert-info}
**NOTE:**
The command will only work for releases that are in the draft state. It won't
delete a published release.
